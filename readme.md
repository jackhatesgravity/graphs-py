# Overview

I've just spent four months working through my DSA unit and honestly don't feel like I've learned anything. This project is my way of making sure I've actually covered the basics. Using only basic guides, mostly CLRS for the maths of it, I want to work through the various graphs based algorithms and data structures so I can actually get to grips with these concepts in a language I'm more familiar with. The longer-term goal is to take these concepts and apply them to other languages, but I need to get the fundamentals down, first.
